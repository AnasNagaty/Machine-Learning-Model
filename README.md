# Machine-Learning-Model


Create a machine learning model in Python for predicting the prices of houses in a big city based on various data sources. The scope of the work includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and hyperparameter tuning.

1. Get historical housing cost information from a reliable source like real estate websites or government databases. 
2. Get other information that could modify house prices like economic indexes, crime levels, school standards, public transportation accessibility as well as local amenities. 
3. Deal with absent figures, exceptional cases in addition to varying records. 
4. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data distribution and identify key patterns.
5. Create new features from existing data to capture more complex relationships (interaction terms, polynomial features).
6. Integrate external data sources to enhance the model (economic trends, weather patterns).
7. Perform feature selection to retain the most impactful features for the model.
